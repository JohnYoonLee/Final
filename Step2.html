        Welp, what do you think? Regardless of what you think, at the end of the day, you got a choice to make. No one will judge you 
    for the deicison you make. You either stay home, enjoy the occansional glimpse and move on with your regular life. Or you can take 
    the first step in your journey through the gauntlet that all World Warriors walk. It will be grueling, it will be difficult, but I can
    promise you that it can make you become the happiest you can be. At least that's what happened for me!
